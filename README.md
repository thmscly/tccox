Hey, my name's <strong>T.C. Cox</strong>.

I'm a <em>Front-End Engineer</em>, and this is my portfolio web app.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I used traditional CSS, and utilized Hooks to construct the and run state management.
